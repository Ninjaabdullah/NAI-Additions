### Notice
---
I don't recommended including this mod in modpacks while it's in Alpha, As it will go significant changes as I develop it, But if you wish to include it in your modpack, Feel free to do so.

**Always Backup Your World!**

P.S. : I'm making this project for fun! And also to learn Java, It might not get updated or maintained frequently, But I will try to not abandon it.
